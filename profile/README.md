# Welcome to the team 🙌

## About Montagne.ai 🏔️

**Montagne.ai** is the organization behind **Lampe** and **Campement** - a suite of developer tools designed to help teams navigate the wilderness of modern codebases through better reviews, actionable insights, and thoughtful automation.

Our mission is to empower developers to explore their code like a forest expedition, using **Lampe** (🔦) as your torchlight to reveal hidden bugs, confusing code, and opportunities for improvement.

## What We Build

### 🔦 Lampe SDK
An open-source Python SDK that integrates with GitHub Actions to automatically review pull requests using LLMs. Like a torchlight in a dark forest, it reveals:
- Hidden bugs and potential issues
- Code clarity and maintainability concerns  
- Opportunities for refactoring and improvement
- Risk assessment and technical debt

### 🏕️ Campement
Your basecamp for code understanding and team collaboration. After PRs are reviewed by Lampe, all insights are gathered in Campement where teams can:
- Centralize findings across repositories
- Track trends and patterns over time
- Collaborate on improvements
- Build institutional knowledge
